###Director

Clients and projects included:

* Pearson Education/Harcourt Education
ODE World
I was the Lead developer of the ODE World little bits of learning  project where I was responsible for 5 developers within an agile team that included UI Testers, Content Experts, SCRUM Master, Accessibility experts and project and program managers.

I helped gather the original requirements from the domain experts and setup the initial architecture using nUnit tests, RhinoMocks mocking framework and a nAnt/nCover and CruiseControl.NET automated build process. I also worked with the UI Testers to help implement the selenium UI testing framework from Thought Works.

The application was an ASP.NET C# website built using model view presenter, interfaces, inversion of control and factory design patterns using a service layer that an .asmx web service used as a thin wrapper over for a Windows Click Once Smart client that was used for the internal administration of content.

The application also used an XML MarkLogic xml database and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database including Full Text Search for the search engine side of the application.

I also worked on other ad-hoc projects that included writing CSV import tools.

Share-IT 
This file-sharing and management application I quoted and specified was built under budget and within time and is now being used in the UK and South Africa. It enabled the client to share large documents via FTP without the IT department having to manage the IIS security or temporary file storage for often temporary file sharing between staff and external clients.

The application was designed as a c# asp.net front end, SQL Server 2005 backend along with windows service scheduler and a custom solution that I wrote to handle the creation/deletion of windows accounts/ftp virtual directories and the deletion of files.


Design patterns included inversion of control, interfaces, concrete classes and a custom data access layer talking to stored procedures.

* Mesacom (UK) Limited

Postureminder DSE
For this project as a C# developer I helped meet with the client to gather requirements and wrote a specification to design a Display Screen Equipment training and self assessment system that is now being used by Ricoh UK. 

The system I helped to build was built using ASP.NET C# and Microsoft SQL Server backend along with a Window Service scheduling system. This application also used the model view presenter pattern however we re-used the clients own data access layer.

MicroMagnetics
For this application I converted the Photoshop PSD documents into an XHTML template using the Blueprint grid layout code along with Nifty rounded corners javascript for use as the Master Page and helped integrate my client’s Shopping Basket into the application. I also amended and helped write additional stored procedures.

I was also involved with client meetings.

SkyCaddie
For this project I was involved in technical and onsite desktop support including the setup of a domain controller, exchange server and backup and UPS systems.


 * Berkeley Executive Cars
For this client I designed and built a logo and page design using XHTML and CSS. I also provided technical and onsite support for the client.

  * Spratt Endicott Solicitors
I quoted, specified and built a C# asp.net application with Microsoft SQL Server Express backend that is today still used for companywide helpdesk and ticketing support. This application also used LLBLGen pro ORM tools.

 * SS20 Skate Shop
This client required an automated solution that would take and transform data from a custom built CRM and automatically upload this data to an online store provider for their e-Commerce solution. 

This application was a Windows Forms Desktop Application written in C# and had a plug in architecture to allow the same data to be uploaded for future uses such as Amazon, ebay or froogle etc.
